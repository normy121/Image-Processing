Image Processing Homework #1

OS: macOS
Intepreter: Python 3.9.6 64-bit
Python is used in this project, before running hw1.py (source code), make sure to install the following libraries in advance.
1. Install cv2, matplotlib, and numpy. If these libraries have already been installed, you can skip to the second step.
    $ pip3 install opencv-contrib-python
    $ pip3 install matplotlib
    $ pip3 install numpy
2. Run source code (hw1.py)
    $ python3 hw1.py
3. Wait patiently for 27 seconds until the plots show up. The processes of making plots will consume a large amount of time.

This project contains implementations on Power-Law (Gamma) Transformation, Histogram Equalization, and Laplacian sharpening.
Each plot shows an implementation on the screen respectively.
