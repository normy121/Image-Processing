Image Processing Homework #4

OS: macOS
Intepreter: Python 3.9.6 64-bit
Python is used in this project, before running hw4.py (source code), make sure to install the following libraries in advance.
1. Install cv2, matplotlib, and numpy. If these libraries have already been installed, you can skip to the second step.
    $ pip3 install opencv-contrib-python
    $ pip3 install matplotlib
    $ pip3 install numpy
2. Run source code (hw4.py)
    $ python3 hw4.py
3. Wait patiently for 19 seconds until one plot shows up. Convolution will consume a large amount of time.

This project contains implementations of Sobel operator and the Laplacian of a Gaussian operator to achieve edge detection.
Only one plot shows up on the screen.
